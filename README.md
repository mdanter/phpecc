### Information

This library is an actively maintained fork of Thomas Kerin's [`phpecc`](https://github.com/phpecc/phpecc) library, which is a rewrite/update of Matyas Danter's ECC library. All credit goes to them.

For more information on Elliptic Curve Cryptography please read [this fine article](http://www.matyasdanter.com/2010/12/elliptic-curve-php-oop-dsa-and-diffie-hellman/).

The library supports the following curves:

 - secp112r1
 - secp256k1
 - nistp192
 - nistp224
 - nistp256 / secp256r1
 - nistp384 / secp384r1
 - nistp521

During ECDSA, a random value `k` is required. It is acceptable to use a true RNG to generate this value, but 
should the same `k` value ever be repeatedly used for a key, an attacker can recover that signing key. 
The HMAC random generator can derive a deterministic k value from the message hash and private key, voiding
this concern.

The library uses a non-branching Montgomery ladder for scalar multiplication, as it's constant time and avoids secret 
dependant branches.
